# Personal Website
A multipurpose website that serves as my personal portfolio, hosts Minecraft world downloads, and includes custom applications like one for my parents. You can see a deployed version at www.fantasy-web.us, which is hosted on my own hardware. 

# A note on code quality
This repository is not represantative of my current skills. I built it in college, and only maintain it as necessary. It was built and duct taped together only as needed. **In more complex or longer term projects, I would actually write good code**. This is not good code, and it was never intended to be.
